BlueSky Open Air Traffic Simulation program 

Initiated by Jacco M. Hoekstra from TU Delft, faculty of Aerospace Engineering, section Control & Simulation

This program is aimed at CNS/ATM researchers. It is an open source, open data ATM simulation. Sources are programmed
in Python 2.x. Dependencies are:

  - numpy/scipy/matplotlib
  - pygame

For Mac users: be aware the pygame library does not take into account the resolution of the retina displays,
so set the resolution to a lower value.
